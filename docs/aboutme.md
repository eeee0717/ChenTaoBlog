# About me

## Hi there, I'm Chen Tao! ðŸ‘‹
A senior student from **ZSTU** and I am now admitted to **BJUT**.

Dreaming up ideas and making them come true is where my passion lies. You can find my [full projects list here](/aboutme). I also share some technical articles on [Blog](/aboutme)

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing photography and traveling. Some of my photos can be found on [Photos](/aboutme). If you happen to be in the same city I live (currently in Hangzhou), maybe we can hang out and take some photos or code together.
